Subject: [PATCH 1/3] verify_file: ignore xattrs when verifying Manifest files

When IMA or Smack are active on the client, the downloaded Manifest
files will be assigned certain xattrs (security.ima
resp. security.SMACK64). Those xattrs did not exist on the server side
(because it is most likely not having those kernel features enabled)
and besides, the swupd-server code wouldn't include them in the
Manifest hashes even if they existed (see write_manifest_plain() in
src/manifest.c).

Therefore the client must ignore xattrs when verifying Manifest files.
